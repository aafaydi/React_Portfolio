# Getting Started with Create React App

# Disciption:
My task is to build my profolio using React to share your projects not only if you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also so that I can share your work with fellow developers and collaborate on future projects.



# Application Functionalities
A single Header component that appears on multiple pages

A single Navigation component within the header that will be used to conditionally render the different sections of your portfolio

A single Project component that will be used multiple times in the Portfolio section

A single Footer component that appears on multiple pages

# Story
AS AN employer looking for candidates with experience building single-page applications
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed React portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position.

# Deployment:
GitHub: https://github.com/aafaydi/React_Portfolio
Heroku Live: https://yusef-app.herokuapp.com/
